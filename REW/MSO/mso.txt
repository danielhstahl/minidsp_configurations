-10 in REW, 10db-150db sweep, -34 in MiniDSP, no filters in MiniDSP at all.  68 DB "reference".  MLP weight of 1, Left and Right of .5

Since I use the Harman curve (which boosts bass by 6db) and since the subwoofers were already 5.5 DB "hot" to the 68 db "reference", I chose not to apply any gain/trim before performing MSO calibration/measurement.
