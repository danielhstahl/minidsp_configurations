-10 in REW, Pink random, full range (20-20000), -34 in MiniDSP, no filters in MiniDSP at all (no bass management, no PEQ)
L: 67.6 (+.4 to get to 68)
R: 66.8 (+1.2 to get to 68)
C: 70.2 (-2.2 to get to 68)
SL: 68.3 (-.3 to get to 68)
SR: 68.6 (-.6 to get to 68)
SubFront: 73.8 (-5.8 to get to 68)
SubBack: 73.3 (-5.3 to get to 68)

Typically we only want negative gains to reduce risk of digital clipping, however with bass management the 5 satellites are already at -10 to "boost" the LFE channel by 10 db.  Since all the "boosts" are much less than 10 db I am comfortable putting the raw differences from 68 even if they are positive gains.
